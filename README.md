# Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses Documentation

## Introduction:

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing a simple chatbot with rule-based responses. The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined rules using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques. This project aims to give a basic understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow.

## Features:

- Simple rule-based responses.
- Uses if-else statements or pattern matching techniques.
- Provides appropriate responses based on user queries.

## Requirements:

- Python (programming language)
- Text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)
- Basic understanding of Python programming language

## Explanation:

### Importing Libraries:
The `re` library is imported to utilize regular expressions for pattern matching.

### Defining Rules and Responses:
Predefined rules and their corresponding responses are stored in a dictionary named `rules`.

### Chatbot Response Function:
The `chatbot_response` function takes user input and matches it with the predefined rules. If a match is found, the corresponding response is returned. If no match is found, a default response is returned.

### Main Function:
The `main` function initiates the chatbot. It welcomes the user, prompts for input, and continues the conversation until the user types 'exit'.

## User Interactions:

### Starting the Chatbot:
The user starts the chatbot by typing a message. The chatbot responds with a greeting and prompts the user for their query.

### Querying Weather Information:
The user queries about the weather. Since the chatbot cannot provide weather information, it responds accordingly.

### Thanking the Chatbot:
The user thanks the chatbot. The chatbot responds with acknowledgment.

### Ending the Conversation:
The user types 'exit' to end the conversation. The chatbot bids goodbye to the user.

## Conclusion:

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing a simple chatbot with rule-based responses. By following the provided code and explanations, users can create their own chatbots and customize the rules and responses according to their requirements. This project serves as a basic introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow in chatbot development.
